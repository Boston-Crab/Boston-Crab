During my self-taugh Python days, I've made a Pygame Tic Tac Toe and an AutoPlayRPG games.

-> Down below you'll find few images and links to youtube videos for those games.

**1. Pygame Tic Tac Toe:**
   
   First I've created a text based just with python and naturally after that the next step,
   was to do a Pygame conversion. :wink:

**2. Pygame AutoPlayRPG:**

   This is the project that I am the most proud of, as it was fully my brain child.
   Through the process of making it, I understood a lot about writting cleaner code,
   the idea of refactoring, or in other words writing code in such a way that you would
   not need to refactor, and in general learned to learn.

   The game is quite simplistic in a way. There are some menus that you can access, some
   automatic combat systems, scenes and a dungeon crawling system. All assets have been
   generated by AI.
